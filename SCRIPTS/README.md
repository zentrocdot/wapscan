## Foreword

<p align="justify">A WLAN Scanner is sometimes called a WLAN sniffer. In the context of this package I prefer the naming WLAN Scanner.</p>

<p align="justify">The initial work on the WLAN Scanner started in the year 2017. Due to problems with the WLAN Environment at home at and work I needed a simple to use tool to evaluate the routers and other stuff in use.</p>

<p align="justify">My programmed scripts have worked without restriction from the year 2017 to the year 2024. Therefore, there was no need for me to make any changes.</p>

## Development

<p align="justify">I wrote a WLAN Scanner in Bash and in Python. wapscan is simple and pure Bash code using only by standard available tools.</p>

<p align="justify">The first version, which is only conditionally suitable for productive work, has the version number O.O.O.1. This is more a version of historic interest.</p>

<p align="justify">Versions 0.0.0.2 to 0.0.0.4 are intermediate versions. The second to last released version here will be version 0.0.0.4. The latest version after that will be version 0.0.0.5. In this version I streamline internal processes to get a better code structure.</p>
