## Foreword

<p align="justify">A WLAN Scanner is sometimes called a WLAN sniffer. In the context of this package I prefer the naming WLAN Scanner.</p>

<p align="justify">The initial work on the WLAN Scanner started in the year 2017. Due to problems with the WLAN Environment I needed a simple to use tool to evaluate the router in use.</p>

<p align="justify"></p>

## Development

<p align="justify">I wrote a WLAN Scanner in Bash and in Python. wapscan is simple and pure Bash code using only by standard available tools.</p>

<p align="justify">The first version, which is only conditionally suitable for productive work, has the version number O.O.O.1.</p>
